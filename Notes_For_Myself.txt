Notes to Myself:

Decision: Do not use GameObject AL because every method you call on one of its elements must
be specified in the GameObject interface - certainly isn't the case a lot of the time!
For now, just declare GameObjects separately, can make storage class later.

Duplicate class issue resolved (Project Explorer vs. Package Explorer)
Hi, this is actually not really a Mylyn issue but is just the behaviour of the Project Explorer which shows those resources twice by default (whereas I think the Package Explorer always hides these duplicates). You can hide the duplicates by going to the Project Explorer view menu (triangle at top-right of the view) and selecting Customize View -> Content and unchecking Resources.

Following for typical shapes are all doubles:
getX(), getY(), getWidth(), getHeight()

Yucky Bug I May Change Later:
Change window size --> Bounce off of same width/height boundaries

Change later:
Initial positions of GameObjects in Level class --> Make functions of width, not hard coded

Common Error:
blockGrid.getBlock(r, c) --> don't forget may return null!
